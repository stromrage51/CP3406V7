# Assigment thought process

## Why chose recipe app: 
    I created this recipe app because I enjoy cooking and wanted an app that works offline. The idea came to me while travelling in the Tablelands, when I realised my existing recipe app required internet access. Inspired by my mum’s family cookbook and a friend’s frustration with no recipes while camping, I decided to make an app that syncs across devices with a simple, offline-friendly interface. I updated an old app by overhauling its outdated user interface and adding essential features and classes.
